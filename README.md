# One Voice
One Voice is a web based application that allows students to provide feedback to their instructors in Real Time. This is done via a few core features:

1) A chat room environment,
2) Student Surveys and Instructor analytics view,
3) Watson API Sentiment Analysis.
The end goal of this app, is to provide instructors with relevant data to better structure their lessons.  The data collected from students is aggregated and used to compile meaningful reports for instructors.
