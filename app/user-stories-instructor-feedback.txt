One Voice:  Empowering Students Everywhere!
One Voice is a web based application that allows students to provide feedback to their instructors in Real Time.
This is done throuhg a few core features: Firstly, One Voice provides students and instructors with a space to share
thoughts, questions and comments in real time - during the class.  Secondly every student is prompted to fill out a survey,
that rate the instructor's overall preformance, clarity, and pace - while also allowing a space for students to input
questions, comments, or suggestions.  These surveys wuld be completed by students daily after the lesson/lecture.
The end goal of this app, is to provide instructors with relevant data to better structure their lessons.  The data collected
from students would be aggrigated and used to compile meaningful reports to instructors daily...
In a world that changes every minute, it doesn't make sense to provide feedback on a monthly or quarterly time frame.
Feedback should be instant, students should have an avenue to share their collective experience, and it is in the
instructor's interest to empower their students.

INSTRUCTOR: KITTEN DEN FEEDBACK
Many approaches to real time apps -modules is rails / fire base not rails, pull requests to server every x amount og seconds.
Sean - rails - may be easier.
Api - suggestion = IBMM watson - sentient analysis on comments to see if generally positive or not.
live meter for pace - sean
Students - instructor code to log into class room instead of registration system.  - Sean
Only 3 ppl - skinny
