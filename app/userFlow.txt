Devon's Notes/Insight
   Web Sockets - actionCable for rails - rails solution for websockets. Needed for real time comments
   feature.

   The survey is just a form, we should check if user submitted survey before logging out, if not
   we should have the user submit survey upon re-logging in
   - be careful of annoying the user.
